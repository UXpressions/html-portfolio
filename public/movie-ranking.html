    <h1>The Best Movies According to Christian</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
    <p>
      It's an emotional rollercoaster and beautifully illustrates the law of
      attraction. It shows the power of being a genuinely good person.
    </p>

    <h3>The Matrix Series</h3>
    <p>
      Really cool sci-fi movie that plays on the psychological idealogy of being
      indoctrinated to a system while encouraging viewers to break free from it.
    </p>

    <h3>Scareface</h3>
    <p>
      I love a good gangster flick and this is the best! Not to mention it
      includes a story of starting from the bottom and working your way to the
      top.
